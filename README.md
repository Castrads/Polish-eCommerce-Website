**master** is our main branch, it's used to on server to pull commits only. Please do not work directly on that branch. Use *Pull requests* tool to merge your changes with master branch, it helps us to avoid conflicts.
I created **dev** branch what is an exact copy of **master** branch. 

Clone repository on your local directory and use **dev** branch. 

If you want to commit your changes remember about adding appropriate comment using `git commit -m "Comment content"` command.

Use `git pull` on linode server to pull all changes, make sure you are pulling to **master** branch.
